### Different browsers & Mobiles

The website has been tested on following web browsers and mobiles, and website looks fine and work properly on them.
For screen sizes 768px and above the page is divided into three sections History, Top Attraction and Serarch box plus Google Map.
Whereas for small screen sizes every thing turns into one section and sits on top of eachother.

- Google Chroome
- Microsoft Edge
- firefox
- Opera
- iPhone 6
- Iphone 8
- Huawei P30 lite

### Media Queries

Bootstrap has been used to make website responsive but separate media queries has been written to set the map height on different
screen sizes. For screen sizes like 4k-2560px a media query is also written so that website look nice on big screens as well.

### Interesting Bugs

During testing I found an interesting bug. Actually I have a hover function on attraction list which I disabled for small
screens less than 768px. The bug was when I was selecting small screen from large screen this hover was not disabling until,
I refresh the page or I select any location from the dropdown button. It happened to be the same when I was moving from small
screen size to bigger than 768px, hover function was not activating until, I refresh the page or I select any location from
the dropdown button. Luckily I found out that I need to put if statement inside each hover function and it worked.
