## **Known Bugs**

- [ ] The sweep to bottom hover effect doesn't cover the buttons on some mobile phones.

- [ ] Sometimes the browser doesn't open the site but after reloading the page it workes properly.

## **Fixed  bugs**

- [x] When on the menu page, click on the menu button was making an error. The href for the menu page was wrong. The href attribute was changed from href="starter.html" to href="order.html" to fix the problem.

- [x] In some emulated devices, the right to left scroll appears. In most of them after reloading the page, the scroll disappears and the whole page is shown again.

I used the code below from stack overflow to fix the problem:

         html,
         body {
             max-width: 100%;
             overflow-x: hidden;
        }

- [x] Clicking the submit button in modal wasn't resulting in closing the modal.

I used the code below from stack overflow to fix the problem:

        <div class="modal-footer">
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary sign-in-btn" data-dismiss="modal">
                    
- [x] When slides were changing in the carousel, index-note was getting blurry. Also, menu items were getting blurry when hovering over them.

I used the code below from stack overflow for the index-note to fix the problem:
       
        .index-note{
               -webkit-transform: translateZ(0px);
        }
